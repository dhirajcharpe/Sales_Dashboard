# Sales_Dashboard_Report
I have created Sales Dashboard by using Power Bi,

It is E-commerce Sales Dashboard, started from data cleaning, and then data modelling, used DAX Function and later on use visualization.

Used KPI for Exact Number, Card, Multi-Row Card, Clustered bar & column chart, stacked bar chart, Slicer, Pie chart etc.

Major KPI's -
Total Sales, Profit & Profit %
Sales Analysis by Region, Product Category & Product Sub Category.
TOP 5 Customers by Sales
Year Wise Analysis with profit and profit %.
